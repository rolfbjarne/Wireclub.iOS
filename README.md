Wireclub.iOS
============

The Wireclub iOS app was built in the F# programming language using Xamarin's iOS (MonoTouch) framework.

It depends on a couple libraries:

https://github.com/wireclub/wireclub.appclient (base api for different mobile clients)
https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp (realtime events for chat)

We are still waiting to open source the domain models to make all the source code available. (F# as well)

The Wireclub chat app let's you chat with your friends, meet new people and discover great conversations. 

You can join chat rooms, private chat with friends, meet new people and more.
